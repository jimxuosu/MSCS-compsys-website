        <h2>Basic Info</h2>
        <ul>The College of Computing (CoC) was established at Georgia Tech in 1990. Initially, it contained only one school (department): Computer Science. Now the college has four main schools involved in research and teaching:</ul>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>School of Computer Science (CS)</strong></li>
            <li><strong>School of Interactive Computing (IC)</strong></li>
            <li><strong>School of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE)</strong></li>
            <li><strong>School of Cybersecurity and Privacy (CP)</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>In 2023, a fifth school was created for strictly instructional purposes that handles basic undergraduate courses:</ul>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>School of Computing Instruction (SCI)</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>The latest new “SCHOOL” started in FALL 2022 with its program offerings. </ul>
        <ul>
           <li><strong>School of Cybersecurity and Privacy (SCP)</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <ul> It offers an M.S. in Cybersecurity which has in-campus and online versions with their own three tracks, etc.
As M.S. students, you are NOT affected by what course is taught by faculty from which school. You have to meet the requirements of your specialization.</ul>
